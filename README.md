🌌 Skin Disease Prediction Web Application 🌌
This project is a Skin Disease Prediction Web App powered by Streamlit, TensorFlow, and MobileNet V2. The application predicts various skin conditions based on an uploaded image, offering real-time predictions with high accuracy.

🔗 Live at: https://skin-diseases-prediction--app-bb4xpevzzccuynyexsbxjj.streamlit.app/

🎯 Features
Upload Image: Users can upload skin condition images in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png formats.
AI Predictions: The application predicts one of the following skin conditions:
Cellulitis
Impetigo
Athlete's Foot
Nail Fungus
Ringworm
Cutaneous Larva Migrans
Chickenpox
Shingles
Normal (Healthy skin)

Confidence Level: Displays the model's confidence percentage for the predicted disease.
Dark-Themed UI: Enhanced user experience with a visually appealing dark theme.
Real-Time Analysis: Fast predictions using a lightweight and efficient model architecture.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive web interface.
Backend: TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub for deep learning model predictions.
Pre-Trained Model: MobileNet V2 fine-tuned for skin disease classification.
Image Processing: Pillow (PIL) and NumPy for preprocessing the input images.

📜 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of skin disease images sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes the following eight classes of skin diseases:

Cellulitis (Bacterial Infection)
Impetigo (Bacterial Infection)
Athlete's Foot (Fungal Infection)
Nail Fungus (Fungal Infection)
Ringworm (Fungal Infection)
Cutaneous Larva Migrans (Parasitic Infection)
Chickenpox (Viral Infection)
Shingles (Viral Infection)

🧠 How It Works
Upload an Image: Users upload a skin condition image.
Preprocessing: The image is resized to 224x224 and normalized for prediction.
Prediction: The pre-trained MobileNet V2 model predicts the disease based on the input image.
Output: The predicted disease and its confidence level are displayed in a user-friendly interface.

🚀 Usage
Follow these steps to use the application locally:

1. Clone the Repository
