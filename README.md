🌌 Skin Disease Prediction Web Application 🌌
This project is a Skin Disease Prediction Web App powered by Streamlit, TensorFlow, and MobileNet V2. The application predicts various skin conditions based on an uploaded image. It provides accurate predictions using a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model fine-tuned on a custom dataset.

🎯 Features
Upload Image: Users can upload skin condition images in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png formats.
AI Predictions: Predicts one of the following skin conditions:
Cellulitis
Impetigo
Athlete's Foot
Nail Fungus
Ringworm
Cutaneous Larva Migrans
Chickenpox
Shingles
Normal (Healthy skin)
The dataset was sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subirbiswas19/skin-disease-dataset
Confidence Level: Displays the model's confidence in its prediction.
Dark-Themed UI: Enhanced user experience with a custom dark theme for visuals.
Real-Time Analysis: Instant predictions with an easy-to-use interface.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface.
Backend: TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub for AI/ML predictions.
Pre-Trained Model: MobileNet V2 feature extractor.
Image Processing: PIL and NumPy for image preprocessing.
🧠 How It Works
Upload an Image: Users upload a skin condition image.
Preprocessing: The image is resized to 224x224 and normalized.
Prediction: The pre-trained MobileNet V2 model predicts the disease.
Output: The predicted disease and confidence level are displayed on the interface.
